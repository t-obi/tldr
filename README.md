This Repository holds the implementation of team "tldr" for the programming course User-Centered Design at FU Berlin in cooperation with Carmeq GmbH.

The goal of the course was to develop an application using an interface to car data provided by Carmeq, in the User-Centered Design Process.

We chose to develop an augmented-reality multiplayer game where players have to complete tasks which are completed using car data (e.g. drive a certain route at a specific speed). 
A prototype was implemented for Android with an App-Engine backend and tested successfully in a car under live conditions.
